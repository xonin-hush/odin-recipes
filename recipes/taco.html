    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I loved a local chain restaurant's fish tacos so much, that I had to try to duplicate them. They combine flour tortillas filled with breaded, fried tilapia, layered with chipotle mayo, topped with napa cabbage, dressed with honey-cumin sauce, and served with pico de gallo, sour cream, chips, and salsa. You'll find them very refreshing and packed full of flavor!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound tilapia fillets, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>⅓ cup fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 chipotle chilies in adobo sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon adobo sauce from chipotle peppers</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 cups panko crumbs</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 cups 3 color coleslaw blend</li>
        <li>1 cup minced fresh cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>8 (7 inch) flour tortillas, warmed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place tilapia in a flat dish; pour 1/2 cup lime juice on top. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make honey-cumin sauce by whisking together 1/3 cup lime juice, honey, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, and ground cumin in a small bowl; set aside until needed. </li>
        <li>To make chipotle mayonnaise dressing, place mayonnaise, chiles, adobo sauce, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and cayenne pepper in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until needed.</li>
        <li>Place flour, eggs, and panko crumbs in three separate shallow dishes. Season tilapia pieces with salt and pepper to taste; dip in flour to coat evenly and shake off any excess. Then dip in eggs to coat, then panko crumbs, patting to help bread crumbs hold. Set breaded pieces aside on a plate.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 cup vegetable oil in a deep skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Cook fish in hot oil, turning until all sides are golden brown, and flesh is easily flaked with a fork; drain on paper towels and brush with honey-cumin sauce.</li>
        <li>Mix coleslaw and cilantro together in a bowl. Reserve 1/4 cup chipotle mayonnaise dressing, and pour remaining dressing over coleslaw mixture; toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Place tortillas on a flat surface, and spread each with 1 tablespoon of reserved chipotle mayonnaise dressing. Divide fish pieces between tortillas. Top with cilantro coleslaw.</li>
    </ol>
